# gptsh

`gptsh` is a command-line tool that integrates with OpenAI's GPT-4 model to generate and execute shell commands based on user prompts. The tool features multiple modes, including continuous shell mode, chat mode, and a mode that outputs shell commands without executing them.

## Features

- **Chat Mode**: Interact with GPT-4o to generate shell commands or general responses.
- **Continuous Shell Mode**: Run shell commands generated by GPT-4o in an interactive environment.
- **No Execute Mode**: Output the generated shell commands without running them.
- **Environment Integration**: Load configuration from a `.env` file, including the OpenAI API key.

## Prerequisites

Before building or using this project, ensure you have the following:

- Rust programming language installed. You can get Rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
- OpenAI API key: You will need an API key from OpenAI to use the chat features. Set it in a `.env` file.

## Usage

`gptsh` can be run in various modes depending on your needs.

### Help

To view help and available commands:

```bash
gptsh --help
```

### Continuous Shell Mode

This mode allows you to interact with gptsh continuously, generating and executing commands on the fly.

```bash
gptsh --shell
```

### Chat Mode

This mode interacts with GPT-4 as a chat assistant. You need an OpenAI API key set in your environment.

```bash
gptsh --chat
```

Make sure to have the OpenAI API key defined in a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### No Execute Mode

If you want gptsh to generate commands but not execute them, use the `--no-execute` flag:

```bash
gptsh --no-execute "your shell command prompt"
```

### Providing Prompts

You can provide a shell prompt directly via the command line:

```bash
gptsh "create a new directory and list its contents"
```
