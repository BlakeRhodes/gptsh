# GPTsh - A GPT-Powered Shell Environment

`gptsh` is an experimental shell environment that integrates GPT models for human-in-the-loop workflows. Designed to enhance command-line productivity, it enables users to issue natural language commands, generate code snippets, and query complex tasks, all while maintaining a familiar shell interface.

Hereâ€™s a usage example section for your README:

## Usage Examples

Once `gptsh` is installed, you can start interacting with the shell using natural language commands or standard shell syntax.

### Example 1: Running Shell Commands
````bash
$ gptsh list all the files in the current directory
 

Generated Command:
```bash
ls
```

Do you want to execute this command? (Y/n) Y
CoolTerm  Documents  Music     Public		  snap	     Videos
Desktop   Downloads  Pictures  RustroverProjects  Templates
````


### Example 2: Generating a Python Script
````bash
$ gptsh generate a python script to find all my python files
 

Generated Command:
```bash
echo -e "import os\n\nfor root, dirs, files in os.walk('.'): \n\tfor file in files:\n\t\tif file.endswith('.py'):\n\t\t\tprint(os.path.join(root, file))" > find_python_files.py
```

Do you want to execute this command? (Y/n) Y
$ ls
CoolTerm   Downloads             Pictures           snap      
Desktop    find_python_files.py  Public             Templates
Documents  Music                 RustroverProjects  Videos


````

### Example 3: Task Automation
````bash
$ gptsh create the automation to compression and back up my pictures weekly 

Generated Command:
```bash
echo "0 0 * * 0 tar -czf \$HOME/backup/pictures_backup_\$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).tar.gz -C \$HOME/Pictures ." | crontab -
```

Do you want to execute this command? (Y/n) y
$ gptsh show me my cron jobs
 

Generated Command:
```bash
crontab -l
```

Do you want to execute this command? (Y/n) 
0 0 * * 0 tar -czf $HOME/backup/pictures_backup_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).tar.gz -C $HOME/Pictures .
````

### Solve Complex Social Issues
````bash
$ gptsh create a single bash script to solve world hunger and bring world peace
 

Generated Command:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Solving world hunger and bringing world peace cannot be achieved by a script. It requires global cooperation, sustainable development, and compassionate leadership."
```

Do you want to execute this command? (Y/n) Y           
Solving world hunger and bringing world peace cannot be achieved by a script. It requires global cooperation, sustainable development, and compassionate leadership.
````

## Features

- **Chat Mode**: Interact with GPT-4o to generate shell commands or general responses.
- **Continuous Shell Mode**: Run shell commands generated by GPT-4o in an interactive environment.
- **No Execute Mode**: Output the generated shell commands without running them.
- **Environment Integration**: Load configuration from a `.env` file, including the OpenAI API key.

## Prerequisites

Before building or using this project, ensure you have the following:

- Rust programming language installed. You can get Rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
- OpenAI API key: You will need an API key from OpenAI to use the chat features. Set it in a `.env` file.

## Usage

`gptsh` can be run in various modes depending on your needs.

### Help

To view help and available commands:

```bash
gptsh --help
```

### Continuous Shell Mode

This mode allows you to interact with gptsh continuously, generating and executing commands on the fly.

```bash
gptsh --shell
```

### Chat Mode

This mode interacts with GPT-4 as a chat assistant. You need an OpenAI API key set in your environment.

```bash
gptsh --chat
```

Make sure to have the OpenAI API key defined in a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### No Execute Mode

If you want gptsh to generate commands but not execute them, use the `--no-execute` flag:

```bash
gptsh --no-execute "your shell command prompt"
```

### Providing Prompts

You can provide a shell prompt directly via the command line:

```bash
gptsh "create a new directory and list its contents"
```

## Building from Source

Follow these steps to build gptsh from source:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. Install Rust [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) if needed.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gptsh.git
   cd gptsh
   ```

3. Build the project in release mode:

   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

4. After building, the binary will be located in the `target/release` directory:

   ```bash
   ./target/release/gptsh --help
   ```
